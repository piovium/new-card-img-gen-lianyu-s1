## Deployment

Learn more about deploying your application with the [documentations](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)

### Environment variables

- `DATA_CODE_ANALYZER_RESULT_ENDPOINT` configures the `GET` endpoint used to
  load implementation code in debug mode. It defaults to
  `https://play.piovium.org/api/data_code_analyzer_result`.
- `ASSETS_MANAGER_OPTIONS` accepts a JSON object whose properties are passed to
  `AssetsManager`. These properties override the built-in endpoint, version,
  and language options when their keys overlap. It defaults to `{}`.
- For static deployments, configure these variables when running `pnpm build`.
  The supplied Docker Compose configuration forwards them to both the image
  build and the renderer process.
